## API Security.

## Key Security Measures.

### 1. Authentication:

- By ensuring that only legitimate users can access the system by implementing strong and flexible authentication mechanisms.

- By ensuring hash and salt user passwords use bcrypt to protect credentials at rest.

- For session management, by issuing JSON Web Tokens with short lifetimes and refresh tokens for seamless user experiences.

- This combination guards against common threats like credential stuffing and stolen tokens.

- Password hashing with bcrypt and unique salts.

- Short-lived JWT for stateless sessions and refresh tokens for secure re-authentication.

- Multi-factor authentication to block unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.

- Social logins (OAuth2 with providers like Google or Facebook) without storing external passwords.

### 2. Authorization:

- By enforcing fine-grained access control so users only perform actions permitted by their roles.

- By adopting Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) combined with resource-based policies, thereby ensuring hosts can‚Äôt modify others‚Äô listings and only admins can adjust global settings.

- All authorization checks are centralized in middleware for consistency and auditability.

- Role-Based Access Control defining user, host, and admin permissions.

- Object-level authorization to ensure users can only act on their own data (e.g., bookings).

- Centralized policy enforcement through middleware or policy-as-code frameworks.

- Periodic reviews of permissions matrix to detect and revoke excessive privileges.

### 3. Rate Limiting & Throttling:

- To protect APIs from abuse and denial-of-service attacks, rate limiting caps the number of requests per user or IP.

- By using a distributed store like Redis, thereby maintaining counters per endpoint and enforce burst controls to smooth traffic spikes.

- Throttling will also help to mitigate brute-force login attempts and keeps infrastructure performant under load.

- IP-based and user-based request quotas per minute/hour.

- Endpoint-specific rules (e.g., stricter limits on login and payment routes).

- Leaky-bucket or token-bucket algorithms implemented via Redis.

- Graceful rejection with standardized HTTP 429 responses.

### 4. Data Protection & Encryption:

- By securing data both in transit and at rest to meet privacy and compliance requirements.

- All API traffic runs over TLS (HTTPS) to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

- Sensitive fields such as payment details are encrypted in the database, and secrets like API keys or database credentials are stored in a vault or environment variables, not in source code.

- TLS for all client-server and service-to-service communication.

- Field-level encryption for sensitive user and payment data.

- Secrets management via HashiCorp Vault or cloud-provider secrets store.

- Regular rotation of keys and credentials via automated pipelines.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization:

- By preventing injection attacks and malformed data by validating all incoming requests against strict schemas.

- By enforcing whitelists for allowed fields and input formats, thereby guarding against SQL, NoSQL, and command injections.

- Centralized validation logic ensures consistency and simplifies maintenance.

- Schema validation with tools like Joi or Yup for request bodies.

- Parameterized queries or ORM abstractions to prevent injection.

- Sanitization of free-form text to strip malicious content.

- Rejecting unexpected fields early, returning descriptive errors.

### 6. Logging & Monitoring:

- Real-time visibility into the application‚Äôs behavior is critical for detecting and responding to security incidents.

- By logging authentication events, resource access, and errors in a centralized system like ELK or Splunk.

- Alerts trigger on anomalies such as sudden spikes in failed logins or unexpected privilege escalations.

- Centralized audit logs for authentication, authorization checks, and sensitive operations.

- Integration with SIEM for real-time threat detection and alerting.

- Retention policies and immutable storage for compliance and forensic analysis.

- Regular log reviews and automated anomaly detection.

### 7. Next Steps & Extra Security Layers:

- By ensuring beyond core measures, and considering automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD, periodic penetration testing by security professionals, and deploying a Web Application Firewall.

- Implementing Content Security Policy and secure headers, enable CORS properly, and automating security linting in the code pipeline.

- Finally, by developing an incident response plan and disaster recovery procedures to ensure resilience against unforeseen breaches.

- CI/CD security gates with tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check.

- Periodic penetration tests and bug bounty programs.

- Web Application Firewall and DDoS protection (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS WAF).

- Security headers: HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and more.

- Incident response playbooks and regular tabletop exercises.

These layered defenses will collectively fortify this Airbnb-clone backend against a wide range of threats, ensuring both reliability and trust for users and hosts.

**CI/CD Pipeline.**

- What They Are:
    - Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) pipelines are automated workflows that take every code change through a series of steps‚Äîbuilding, testing, and delivering‚Äîso that software can be released reliably and quickly.
    
    - CI focuses on merging developer changes into a shared repository frequently.
    - CD picks up those integrated changes and pushes them through staging or production environments with minimal manual intervention
    
    Automating these stages ensures that every commit is validated and ready for deployment at any time.
